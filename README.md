# 🍔 Fast Food Optimization for Healthy Eating  
🚀 **Linear Programming Model to Optimize Fast Food Meal Choices**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements **linear programming** to help users **select the healthiest fast food meal** based on nutritional constraints.  
It uses **Google OR-Tools (`pywraplp`)** to **maximize or minimize** nutrient intake based on a user’s weight.  

📊 **Key Features:**  
✔️ **Optimizes macronutrients** (Protein, Carbs, Fats, Sugars) based on user input.  
✔️ **Uses Google OR-Tools (`pywraplp`)** to find the best meal combination.  
✔️ **Includes Power BI visualizations** to analyze food nutrition data.
